Submission for HACK4WOMEN GirlScript India Summit Hackathon
Problem Statement - Open Innovation Ideas


We are building a web portal for small business women owners where they can post about their business and get the online recognition they need. We are trying to provide a platform for them which lists all businesses who register so that more consumers can be engaged with them based on nearby location. Through our platform they can also hire some people to expand their business by posting for job vacancies. So ultimately this is women only platform on which small business women owners will be able gain scale in market and people will get to know about these startups.
